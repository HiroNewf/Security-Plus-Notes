# Security+ Notes
Just passed Network+ so unto the Security+. This will be my notes for the test, mainly based of the Professor Messer's videos, but there might be bits and peices of information that I compiled from elsewhere. Also around 2.5 I gave up on taking serious notes on the stuff I already know from Network+ so some stuff may be missing.

        - But it itself might be adware or other malware
- Spyware
    - Malware that spies on you
        - Advertising, identity theft, affiliate fraud, ect
        - Browser monitoring, keyloggers, ect
    - Often installed via a Trojan horse
- Adware and spyware can make the attacker a ton of money
- Protecting against it
    - Have an up to date anti virus software
    - Know what you are installing and make sure you trust it
    - Keep file backups as the adware and spyware is hard to remove from a system

## [Bots and Botnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHrES3Swpw4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=18&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Bots
    - An infected computer that is a bot for someone else
        - Installed via a Trojan horse, vulnerability, alongside a another software program, ect
- Botnet
    - A group of bots
    - Just sits around until the Command and Control (C&C) server tells them to do something
    - All of systems can cause many problems like DDoS attacks
        - Can proxy spam, network traffic, be rented out, ect
- Stopping them
    - Prevent them from installed in the first place
        - OS and application patches
        - Anti virus software
    - Using an on demand network scan can find existing infections
    - C&C Can be block at the firewall if you know what to look for

## [Logic Bombs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=javj1IqXKW0&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=19&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Waits for a certain event to be triggered and then activates
    - Occurs when a date and time is reached
    - Occurs when a certain user event takes place
- Hard to identify and hard to recover
    - Many delete themselves once they execute
- Preventing them
    - Formal change control process
        - Know when things are being modified
    - Automated monitoring
        - Host based intrusion detection, Tripwire, ect
    - Constant auditing
        - Admins can go around other systems so auditing is good to keep track of what they and other users are doing
## [Password attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNhak8IilrA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=20&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Plaintext passwords
    - Stored in a readable format
    - This is a terrible idea (dont use apps that do this)
- Hashing a password
    - Input your password and pick which hash type to use
        - Get a random series of numbers and letters in return
        - Inputting this password will always give you the same hash but it is very hard to get the password from the hash itself (other than brute force)
- Spraying attacks
    - Avoids locking the account by trying so many passwords
    - Use the most common passwords and moves on if this does not work
        - No alarms, alerts, or lockouts
- Brute Force
    - Trying every single possible password (or hash)
    - Takes a lot of time and a lot of compute power
    - Hard to do online as their is often delays and lockouts
        - But it is possible offline with hashes
- Dictionary attacks
    - Use the most common words to try and find the correct password
    - There are many different wordlists that can be broken down by native language, line of work, hobbies, etc that can be useful if you know things about your target and their life
    - Can substitute letters like replacing 0 with O and replacing 2 with @
    - Takes some time but not nearly as long as brute force attacks
- Rainbow tables
    - An optimized pre-built set of hashes
    - Easy and quick to search through
        - Almost instantly
    - Need different tables for different hashing methods
- Adding salt
    - Random data added to a password BEFORE it is hashed
    - Every user gets their own random salt data
    - Rainbow tables will not work against this
        - Slows down the brute force process

## [Physical Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOGCvcfJl4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=21&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Malicious USB cable

    - Could tell OS that it is a HID and be able to type things
        - Gain control of your system and install malware and the likes
    - Dont plug in random cables
- Malicious Flash Drive
    - Like the USB cable it has additional electronics inside that cause issues to your PC
    - Could act as a HID like the USB cable
        - Like in USB drop attacks with the Rubber Ducky
    - Files in the drive could also infect your system
        - If you open this picture a program runs, etc
    - Could act as a boot device or Ethernet adapter
- Skimming
    - Stealing credit card information usually during a normal transaction
        - Copying magnetic stripe or the info written on the card
    - Requires extra hardware on the scanners
        - Could also have a camera to learn your PIN
- Card Cloning
    - Get card details from a skimmer and then make an exact duplicate
    - Commonly used with magnetic stripe cards
        - The chips cant be cloned
    - Can also happen with gift cards

## [Adversarial Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXZ-BF8Ot-o&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=22&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Machine Learning
    - Computers are getting smarter

    - Requires and ton of data and compute power
    - It is used everyday
        - Spam filter that recognizes spam
        - Ads recommended based on your search history and other data
        - etc
- Poisoning the training data
    - Confuses the AI with fake info
    - Make the AI act how you want based on the info you sent to it
- Evasion attacks
    - AI is only as good as the training
    - Attackers can change their approach to try and get around the machine learning
    - An attacker may be able to extract the data from a AI that used real world information to be trained
- Securing the learning algorithms
    - Make sure learning data is legitimate
    - Keep it up to date with the latest information
    - Use the attackers methods to make sure your system is no vulnerable

## [Supply Chain Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOnjqpw5rXM&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=23&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Many moving parts in the supply chain
    - If one is attacked it can effect the others (the entire chain in some cases)
- People tend to trust the supplies even though they could have been attacked
- Supply chain security
    - Make sure what you are installing is trust worthy
    - Limit the number of vendors you work with
    - Have good policies and procedures (make sure your suppliers do the same)

## [Cloud-based vs On-premises attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ta0rVTL_g&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=25&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Attacks can happen anywhere
- Cloud security
    - Everything is centralized
    - Cheaper
    - No physical access
    - Third party does have access though
    - Large scale security that may be better than what you can do
    - Need to make sure your users are following the best practices
    - Limited downtime due to more redundancy and high quality products
    - Easy to change and update things
        - May be limited on what you can do with the data though
- On-premises security
    - On site and more costly
    - Full control of everything
    - On site team makes things more secure (hire the right people)
    - No need to call out to a third party
    - Take be time consuming and not instantaneous

## [Cryptographic Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ta0rVTL_g&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=25&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Encrypted data sent to another person may not be secure the whole way to its destination
- Finding ways to undo security during the transfer process
    - implementation is often the problem
- Birthday attack
    - Hash collision is when you have two very different plaintexts that both create the same hash
        - Should not happen
    - Attacker tries to find the other plaintexts the matches a certain hash
        - Can be prevented by increasing the has output size
- Collisions
    - Hashes are supposed to be a unique value and it is quite bad when they are not
- Downgrade attack
    - Instead of using a good encryption you use something that is not that great
        - Force system to downgrade security
    - Sit in the middle and influence the encryption choice between two systems
        - Man in the middle attack may be used for this
## [Privilege Escalation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksjU3Iu195Q&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=26&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Gain high access to a system
    - Admin or root access from a normal users access
- Or just gaining access another user of the same level account
- Tend to be patch quickly
    - Keep anti virus up to date
- Data Execution prevention
    - Only allows applications to run in certain areas of memory
- Randomize where stuff is stored in memory to keep people from find the same data over multiple systems

## [Cross-site Scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI0XF2xFg8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=27&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- aka XSS
    - Originally a browser vulnerability that allowed info from on site to be shared with another
- Common web app vulnerabilities
    - Takes advantage of the trust a user has for a site
- Uses JavaScript
- Non-persistent XSS attack
    - A site that allows scripts to run in user input
    - Attacker needs the user to click a link to start this attack (usually an email link)
    - Can get a lot of useful information from the victims machine
- Persistent XSS attack
    - Attacker posts a message to a social network (or other) that has the malicious payload
    - Everyone who reads the post gets the script
    - Many different targets, can spread quickly
- Tokens should have a limited amount of time and should NOT last forever
    - If they last forever you can get around the need to login
- Protecting against it
    - Be careful when clicking links
    - Could disable JavaScript entirely (but not very practical)
    - Keep your browser up to date
    - Devs should make sure that their input fields are validated

## [Injection Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4KUdwh8rGo&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=28&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Code Injection
    - Attacker puts their own code into a data stream
    - HTML, SQL, XML, ect
- SQL injection
    - The most common relational database management system language
    - Your site should not allow this, but some do
- XML Injection
    - XML is common for transferring data between devices
    - Modifying the XML requests
        - This should not be possible
- LDAP injection
    - Has useful information stored in it
    - Modify the requests to get what you want
- DLL Injection
    - Inject code into an application and make the application execute the code
    - Runs as part of the normal process by attaching itself to a normal process

## [Buffer Overflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szTG9w3jImA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=29&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- When one section of memory can overwrite another section of memory
    - Takes advantage of poor programming
- Hard to find and take advantage of
- A good buffer overflow for an attacker is one that can be replicated and is easy to control

## [Replay Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHydDY7wQJg&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=30&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Useful information is often transmitted over the network
    - Hackers can take advantage of this
- Needs to gather the data
    - Network tap, ARP poisoning, malware victim, etc
    - Get session IDs, credentials, etc
- If an attacker takes this gathered information and replays it through the network like it was coming from you than this is a replay attack
    - Replay attack can happen a long time after the gathering of the data
        - Does not involve the original user
    - Pretend you are the normal user sending normal data
- Session Hijack
    - The attacker gains access to the session ID
    - Can pose as the victim without login details needed
    - Get the session ID from wireshark or kismet
        - Or cross-site scripting
    - These headers or cookies need to then be modified
- Preventing them
    - Encrypting the information can stop this from being and issue as even if the attackers receives the data they cannot unencrypt it
        - Salting and peppering the data also helps
    - Make sure to secure the cookies!
        - They hold information like session management, session IDs, personalization, etc
## [Request Forgeries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmtqMzP7aXI&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=31&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Cross-site requests
    - Common and legitimate
    - Loading information from other sites (YouTube, twitter, etc)
    - Browser directs the page to find the right data
        - Most of these requests are unauthenticated
        - Client side code
            - Graphics and texts
                - HTML JavaScript
            - Server side code
                - Performs requests
                    - HTML PHP
    - One-click attack / session riding / client side request forgery (XSRF. CSRF)
        - Takes advantages of the trust a site has for the browser
            - Attacker gets access to your accounts via your browser which already has all the info needed
        - Web servers need to put techniques to prevent this
            - Cryptographic tokens or the likes
    - Server side request forgery (SSRF)
        - Sends requests to a web server and the web server performs the request on the behalf of the attacker
            - Allows lots of access that they should not have
        - Needs a vulnerable application running on the web server
            - Caused by bad programming
            - Rare but critical vulnerabilities

## [Driver Manipulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EI0Rs1QAes&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=32&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Traditional anti virus software is good a stopping know vulnerabilities
- There are still ways to get into the system though
    - Unknown attacks (zero-day attacks), new and different attacks
- Attack with the drivers for your system
    - The drivers are trusted by the system already
        - So you can get a lot of information by infecting them
            - Keyloggers, video footage, audio, etc
- Shimming
    - Fit between two objects
    - OS have shims as well
        - Run applications as if they are running in a different OS
            - has a cache to store this information
        - This can be taken advantage of by hackers and place malware here
- Refactoring
    - A different program each time its downloaded
        - Will not match any signatures as it is always different
    - Make the malware look different than it is
    - Hard to detect with signature based detection

## [SSL Stripping (HTTP downgrade)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1QM6G4Zmos&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=33&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack

    - A man in the middle attack
        - Proxy server
        - Arp spoofing
        - Rogue hotspot
        - etc
    - Looks normal from the victims machine
- SSL is depreciated
    - TSL 1.0 and 1.1 are also depreciated
    - TSL 1.2 and 1.3 are the latest standards
- Avoiding this
    - Use HTTPS and dont allow downgrades

## [Race Conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg_kTCOcinQ&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=34&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Problems can occur if multiple things happens at the exact same time and you were ready for that
- Time-of-check to time-of-use attack (TOCTOU)
    - Checking for things to occur on the system and making changing while knowing that other things may be going on behind the system
    - Like performing two bank transactions at nearly the same time
        - Could lead to duplicating some of the money and causing issues

## [Other Application Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qobt7mkZk2A&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=35&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Memory vulnerabilities
    - Memory Leaks
        - Unused memory is not properly released
        - Application continues to use more and more of the memory until it is all gone
            - System or application crashes | DoS
    - NULL pointer dereference
        - Make a system direct to a null portion of memory where nothing exists instead of the correct data
            - Applications crash, debug info, DoS
    - Integer overflow
        - Large number is placed into a smaller section of memory making said memory overflow
            - Can be repeatable
- Directory transversal
    - Read areas of a server that they should not have access to
        - Bad OS or bad software program
        - May be able to backwards through the file systems to the C drive
- Improper Error handling
    - Errors happens
    - Massages should have just enough information
        - Some tell you too much and this is bad
    - Easy to fix as long as you have control of the application
- Improper input handling
    - All input could be malicious so check it all
    - Dont allow code input like SQL injections
    - Hard for attackers to find these but once they do it can be very bad
- API attacks
    - Manipulating the application programming interference
    - Look for vulnerabilities in the new communication path
        - Exposing data, intercepting communications, more access, DoS, etc
- Resource exhaustion
    - Specialized DoS
    - May use a very small compressed file and that is a HUGE uncompressed file (zip bomb)
        - Anti viruses can detect these
    - DHCP starvation
        - Flooding the network with many new fake devices
        - Make the DHCP server run out of addresses
            - Switch configs can limit the number of requests allowed
## [Rogue Access Points and Evil Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdoHB08VZQU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=36&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- WAP
    - Unauthorized wireless access points
        - Not always malicious but always a security issue
    - Quite easy to do
    - Survey the area every so often to stop this
        - WiFi pineapple or other tools help to stop this
    - Why it is good to use 802.1X
- Wireless Evil Twin
    - Always malicious
    - Designed to look exactly like all of your other WAPs
    - Try to overpower your existing APs (make itself the primary AP)
        - A big issue for already open networks
    - Make sure to encrypt the communication

## [Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP-PYNfOK5g&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=37&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Bluejacking
    - Unsolicited message over Bluetooth
    - Typically limited to a 10 meter distance
        - Attacker needs to be close
    - Can write a message to send to the victim including things like contact card, video, etc
    - Low priority security concern as it is just send a message nothing more
        - As long as the users know how to handle it, it is not that bad
- Bluensarfing
    - Higher security risk
    - Able to access data on your mobile device via the Bluetooth communication channel
    - Was patched quickly and is not an issue on updating modern devices
## [Wireless Disassociation Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJzhe1r_bK4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=38&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Things are working normally, until everything disconnects (and this keeps happening)
    - May not be able to stop this
- A significant DoS attack
- Takes advantage of 802.11 management frames
    - These frames make sure everything works
        - Conversations that you never see but always are happening
    - The original standard did not protect these frames so they could be messed with easily
        - An attacker could cause problems by sending their own management frames and messing with existing ones
- Protecting against it
    - Updates/patches were made a while ago to fix this
    - Made the frames encrypted
        - Not all but some of them (the important ones that can be)
    - 802.11ac requires these protections to be in place

## [Wireless Jamming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKQWbwIAm3U&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=39&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Radio Frequency jamming (RF)
    - DoS
    - Transmit interfering signals to lower the signal to noise ratio
- Sometimes this inference is not intentional
    - But it could be
- Wireless jamming
    - Constant random bits may be sent
    - Constant legitimate traffic may be sent
    - Can happen intermittently as well
    - Only send jamming signal when someone else is also trying to communicate
        - Limited a signal device from communicating
- Interference needs to overwhelm the actual data so it needs to be close to the physical network
    - Hard to hunt down the source
    - May use a fox hunt to find it
        - Find the strongest signal

## [RFID and NFC Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSyFGFIprQU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=40&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Radio Frequency Identification
    - Access cards, tracking, animal identification, etc
    - Uses radar technologies
        - No battery needed (although some can have batteries)
        - The signal is what powers it
    - Unidirectional or bidirectional
- RFID attacks
    - Data capture
        - Viewing the communication
        - Replay attacks
    - Spoofing the reader
        - Write your own data to the tag
    - DoS
        - Jamming
    - Decrypt communication
        - Many default keys are viewable on google
- NFC

    - Payment systems, Bluetooth pairing, access tokens
- NFC security issues
    - Remote capture
    - Jamming (DoS)
    - Relay / Replay attack
    - Loss of control of the device

## [Randomizing Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooOnVzbpXVA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=41&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Encrypted data should look nothing like the plain text
    - If it does look like the plain text it may be able to be reverse engineered
- Nonce
    - An arbitrary number that is used one time
    - A random number
        - Something that cannot be guessed
    - Often used during a login process
    - Combining the data with the nonce and then sending it across the network
        - Sending the same data will look different every time because the nonce will be different
    - IV (Initialization vector) is a common type of nonce
- Salt
    - Nonce being included in passwords as well
    - Passwords should always be salted

## [On-Path Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY20_7l8AKc&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=42&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Formally known as **man in the middle attack**
- The victim does not know it is happening
- Originally data is intercepted and then passed on to where it needs to go
    - Attack and read and change anything that goes through the communication
- ARP poisoning is a common example of this
    - ARP does not have security so this is easy to do
        - Change the ARP table in a device to redirect traffic to the attacker
        - Requires the attacker to be on the local network
- On-path browser attack
    - Attacker is on the same computer as the victim
    - Malware that is the relay between the victim and the other devices is on the victims browser
        - Usually an automated process that handles all of this
    - Can read the plain text data unlike with ARP poisoning

## [MAC Flooding and Cloning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54kfAXpQtWo&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=43&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- I’m not going to write all of this because I already know it and I am too lazy to do it again
- MAC Flooding
    - There is only so much room in the MAC table
    - Attackers could try and fill up the table
        - Force out the legitimate MAC addresses
        - When the table is full it sends every frame to every device
            - Now acts like a hub
            - Could easily overload the network
            - Also good for the attacker to get all of the data
    - Most switches protect against this
        - Flood Guard
- MAC cloning / MAC spoofing
    - Modify their MAC to match the MAC of a legit device on the network
    - Circumvent the filters on the firewalls
    - Could create a DoS attack
        - Disrupt communication to the legitimate MAC

- Changes are always happening
    - OS, patches, upgrades, changes, etc
- Identify and document hardware and software changes
    - Should be able to rebuild the entire systems based only on the information in your documentation
- Diagrams
    - The physical wire and devices
    - Sever racks
    - Patch cables and panels
- Baseline configuration
    - The security of an application should be well defined
    - Firewall settings, patch levels, software versions
    - Integrity measurements check for the security baseline
- standard naming conventions
    - Needs to be easily understood by everyone
    - Asset names and numbers
    - Port labeling
    - Domain configurations
        - Standard for usernames and emails

## [Protecting Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maggnNPkKJM&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=61&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Data is stored everywhere
    - This data needs to be protected
    - Permissions to the data need to be properly managed
- Data sovereignty
    - There are rules on how data is protected in different countries
    - Laws may prohibit where data is stored
        - data collected on EU residents must be stored on EU servers
    - These laws are complex
- Data masking
    - Hide the original data
    - Censor the private information from being viewed
        - many different techniques to do this
- Data encryption
    - Encode information into unreadable data
    - The encrypted data should be very different from the plaintext version
    - Diffusion
        - If you change one piece of information in the plaintext then the cypher tevt should be very different
- Data at rest
    - When the data is on a storage device
    - This data should be encrypted
    - Apply permissions to the data
- Data in transit
    - Data moving across the network
    - Not much protection as it travels
        - Firewalls, IPS, encryption is good to do
- Data in use
    - In the memory of the system
    - Almost always decrypted
    - Attackers can take this data out of the RAM
- Tokenization
    - Replace the sensitive data with non sensitive placeholder
    - Common for credit card processing
    - This isn’t hashing or encryption
        - The two numbers are not mathematically related
- Information rights management (IRM)
    - Control how data is used
    - Restrict data access to unauthorized persons
        - Prevent copy and paste
        - Changing the document
        - etc

- Stop the data before the attackers get it
    - Tons of sources and destinations
- On your local computer
    - Endpoint DLP
    - Data in use
- On your network
    - For data in motion
- On your server
    - Data at rest

- Geographical considerations
    - Legal implications
        - Laws of other states or countries
    - Having to get to another country for maintenance or other
    - Offsite backups
        - Make sure you have good access to your data
        - What access does third parties have?
    - Offsite recovery
        - Travel considerations for support staff
- Response and recovery controls
    - Attacks are often and complex
    - A incident response plan needs to be established
    - Limit the impact of the an attacker
- SSL/TLS inspection
    - Commonly used to examine outgoing SSL/TLS
    - SSL is much older and not often used
    - If the data is encrypted how can you read and filter it?
        - Is not done easily
        - Relies on trust
        - Put yourself in the middle of the conversation
            - Like a man in the middle (but not malicious)
    - Trust me I’m SSL
        - You browser has a list of trusted CAs
        - The CA has performed some checks to make sure the site can be trusted
- Hashing
    - Represent data as a short string of text
    - One-way trip
        - Once you hash the data there is no way to unhash the data
    - Good for verifying integrity (like lots of software downloads provide)
    - Can also be a digital signatures
    - Two messages should not have the same hash
        - No collisions
- API considerations
    - Application programming interfaces
        - Control software or hardware with programmatically
    - Secure and harden the API (Login page or other)
    - On path attack (Man in the middle attack)
        - Intercept and modify API messages
        - API injection
            - Inject data into an API message
    - DDoS via API calls
- API security
    - Authentication
        - Limit API access to users
    - Authorization
        - Not allow external access
        - Read only should not be able to make change
        - etc
    - WAR (Web Application Firewall)
        - Apply rules to API communication

- Recovery site is prepped
    - Business process fail over to the alternate site
    - Can be at the recovery site for a long time
- Need process for returning to the original location
- Hot site
    - An exact replicate of your data center/network
    - Automatically synced all of your data
- Cold site
    - No hardware, just an empty building
    - You need to bring the data and equipment with you
    - Bring your own people as well
- Warm site
    - Between a hot site and cold site
    - Just enough to get going
        - Has some equipment
        - You bring the data

## [Honeypots and Deception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpa9QFuou5k&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=65&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Honeypots look like the real network
    - But they are fake and a trap for the attackers
    - Can see what methods that attackers are doing
    - Should look as real as possible
- Honeyfiles and Honeynets
    - Honeynet is a bunch of honeypots together
        - A group of servers and other devices
    - Honeyfiles
        - Attractive files to attract the attackers
        - Alerts if someone does something with these files
- Fake telemetry
    - Machine learning to take all of this data and find patterns
        - Train the machine with real data
    - Based on actions not signatures
    - Attackers will try and add fake telemetry into the machine
        - Make you think the malware is good via the training
- DNS sinkhole
    - A DNS that hands out incorrect IP addresses
    - An attacker can redirect user to a malicious site
        - Or do a DoS attack
    - Can also be good though
        - Watch for users going to certain malicious IP addresses and know they are infected with malware
            - Block that connection
    - Can be integrated with a firewall

    - Hybrid
        - Mix of private and public

## [Edge and Fog Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KfBFVoA3JA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=67&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Cloud computing
    - On demand computing
    - Fast implementation
    - Tons of resources
    - Cheaper than making your own data center
    - Not always the best option for some situations
- Edge computing
    - IoT devices are everywhere
    - A lot of the processes and application data is on the device itself
        - This is edge computing
- Fog computing
    - IoT devices may also take some of the data and put it in the cloud
    - Cloud computing but not everything need to be in one single place
        - Data could be local or on the cloud
    - Your private data can stay local and safe

## [Designing the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNoQCZdWEOE&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=68&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- On demand computing power
    - Scale up and down easily
    - Access everywhere
- Thin client
    - Basic application usage in the cloud
    - Just enough computing power to connect to the cloud devices
    - Needs a good network connection
- Virtualization
    - Many OS on one single piece of hardware
    - Uses a hypervisor to make this all possible
        - Manages everything
    - Can be expensive
- Application containerization
    - Contains everything you need to run an application
    - A single host OS needed
        - Uses a docker to run each application in its own sandbox
        - All apps are self contained
    - Lightweight, portable (standardized), secure separation
- Microservices and APIs
    - Monolithic application
        - One big application that does everything
        - Self contained
        - Complex
    - Microservices
        - APIs to break up the application into small services
        - API is the glue for the microservices
        - Very scalable
        - Resilient
            - Outages are contained
        - Better security and compliance
- Serverless architecture
    - Function as a service (FaaS)
    - Remove the OS from the equation
    - Runs in a stateless compute containers
        - Responds to the API requests
        - Only available as you need them
    - Managed by a third part often
        - They security is their problem
- Transit gateway
    - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
        - A pool of resources created in a public cloud
        - Only used by you though
    - Access VPCs through a transit gateway
        - Need to make sure it is secure
            - On different subnets
            - Via a VPN
- Resource policies
    - Assigning permission to cloud resources
        - Limit how different users can use the resources
- Service Integration
    - Service integration and management (SIAM)
        - Consolidating the different cloud services
    - Every provider works different
        - SIAM helps you mesh all of these providers together
        - Manage and monitor them in one place

## [Infrastructure as code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIgp6BGr4C8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=69&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Describe the infrastructure in code
    - Create different versions/instances of applications and other things
    - Use the code to make sure the instances are deployed the same way every time
    - Very important in cloud computing
- SDN (Software Defined Networking)
    - Separating the management of a device and the data of a device
        - Centrally managed
    - Directly programmable
    - Agile
        - Changes are made dynamically
    - Vendor neutral
- SNV (Software defined visibility)
    - You must see the traffic to secure the data
    - Deploy NGFW and other security devices while understanding what data is flowing between all of the systems
        - SIEM for monitoring is very important for this
    - New technologies are always being added so the SNV has to be ready for this

## [Virtualization security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIilYOy0PEQ&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=70&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- VM sprawl avoidance
    - Click a button and you have built a server
        - It can become too easy to do this
    - VMs are everywhere and you are not tearing them down when they are no longer needed
        - You need a formal process and detailed documentation for this
- VM escape protection
    - The VM is self contained
        - Or is it?
        - VMs can escape
            - An attacker on VM may be able to access another VM
            - Gives you great control that you should not have
- Escaping the VM
    - It is very rare but it can be very bad when it happens

## [Secure Deployments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upSfrqMEztE&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=71&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Development, deployment, patches and more all needed to be carefully monitored and manged
- Sandboxing
    - Isolated testing environment
        - Test aspects of applications
    - Try lots of ideas with the code with disrupting the production environment
- Building the application
    - Development
        - Writing and testing the code
    - Test
        - Put all of the pieces together and see how they work
- Verifying the application
    - Quality Assurance (QA)
    - Make sure things are working as they should
        - Test new features and new applications
    - Staging
        - Almost read to roll out
        - Test the application in a real world environment
            - Use production data and other things to test
- Using the application
    - Application is live
    - Impacts the users
        - Need to learn how to use the application
    - New servers, new software and other things may be needed
- Secure baselines
    - The security of an application should be well defined
    - Define things like settings, patches, OS versions, etc
    - Integrity checks are also good
        - Make sure production environment matches the security baseline

## [Provisioning and Deprovisioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWhKVehWxbo&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=72&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Provisioning
    - Process of making something available
    - Deploying application instances or other things
        - Make sure it is operational and secure
- Scalability and elasticity
    - Can it scale to demand?
        - Make sure you can handled the load you need with some room for future growth
    - Change easily?
        - If you need to go higher than the scalability you had in place can you change the application to be able to accommodate the new demand?
        - Increase or decrease the available resources
- Orchestration
    - Automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of instances
    - Can change where these instances are as well
    - Security polices should also be a part of this process
- Deprovisioning
    - Dismantling and removing an application instance
        - Remove all traces of it
            - The actual things, security settings, physical devices, etc
        - Make sure to handle the data properly
            - Dont just leave it out there

## [Secure Coding Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIGEjy-W4Q&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=73&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Secure coding concepts
    - A balance between time and quality (Security is also something to think of)
    - Testing process also takes time
- Stored procedures
    - For database calls
    - Clients should not be able to modify requests/calls that happen between the application and the database
        - Stored procedures help to prevent this
            - stops the client from modifying the parameters of the queries
    - Make an application that doesn’t use and SQL queries
- Obfuscation/camouflage
    - Make something normally understandable hard to understand
    - Make code look like nonsense to most humans
        - The computer can still understand it perfectly
    - Helps to prevent people from finding security vulnerabilities in the code
- Code reuse/dead code
    - Use old code to build new applications
        - Common to do as it saves time
    - If the old code is vulnerable to attacks than now more applications are vulnerable
    - Dead code
        - The results aren’t used / the code is unnecessary
        - Remove this as it leave more room for a security issue to be present
- Input validation
    - Validate actual vs expected input
        - Document all input methods
    - Make sure data is in the right format and fix it the data if it is not in the right format
        - If it invalid send an error message and dont accept the input
- Validation points
    - Server side validation
        - All check occur at the server
        - Prevents the use from making changes to the data between the validation and reaching the server
    - Client side validation
        - End users application does the validation
        - Can be faster
    - Both
        - A lot of places use both types
        - Server side is a must though
- Memory management
    - Be mindful of how memory is used
    - Never trust data input
        - Try to stop attackers from circumventing the code
    - Buffer overflows
        - Send more data than what is expected and overflow a section of memory
        - Can cause crash or give the user more access than they should have
    - Good for devs to right their own logic to try and prevent this
- Third-party libraries and SDKs
    - Programming languages do everything
        - Almost
    - Libraries and SDKs
        - Extend the functionality of programming
        - Saves you time
        - Can cause security issues as they are written by someone else
            - Make sure to check and see if it is secure
- Data exposure
    - Lots of sensitive data is being handled
        - Make sure it is secure
            - Encrypted
    - Monitor all input and outputs to make sure data is not being exposed
- Version control
    - Track the changes and be able to update and rollback versions
    - Commonly used for software development and other
    - Good for security as well
        - Keep track of changes
        - Historical reference is a good security tool as well

## [Software Diversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Dk5-F7SEU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=74&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Exploiting an application
    - Once you exploit one binary you can exploit them all
        - Patches are needed for everything when there is an issue
    - Make computers all run different software
        - They could all run windows 10 but have unique binaries
- Software diversity
    - Alternative compiler paths that result in a different binary each time
    - Functionally is the same, but to the hackers they are quite different
        - If a vulnerability is found for a binary it will likely only work with one machine
    - Adds additional work and complexity
## [Automation and Scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ciE3zjKe4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=75&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Always need to plan for changes
    - Automatically
- Continuous monitoring
    - Check for a certain even and then automatically react
- Configuration validation
    - Automatically validate configs before going live
- Continuous integration (CI)
    - Code is constantly written and often deployed
    - So many changes can cause security issues
        - Basic sets of security during development should be done automatically
        - large scale checks after development
- Continuous delivery (CD)
    - Automating the testing and release process
    - Continuous deployment does not even need you to click a button to deploy
        - No human needed

## [Authentication Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPvgt-Bo3k0&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=76&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Directory services
    - Central database for usernames passwords, devices and more
    - Across multiple devices and always up to date
    - One set of credentials for authentication to everything
    - Like Kerberos or LDAP
- Federations
    - Use authentication information from a different site
        - Credentials stored with a third party to authenticate to your network
    - Third parties must establish a trust relationship for this
- Attestation
    - Prove the hardware is really yours
        - A system you know you can trust
    - Becomes more difficult the more devices on the network
        - With large amounts it needs to be automated
    - Remote attestation
        - Checks happen with a verification server and then are digitally signed
            - Allow or prevent access
- Short Message Service (SMS)
    - Text message or other
    - Can be used for 2FA
    - Not the most secure
        - Phone numbers can reassigned or intercepted
- Push notifications
    - Similar to SMS
    - An app to receive the push notification and display it
        - Some security issues
            - Could be sent in the clear
            - The application could be weak
            - etc
    - Still more secure than SMS
- Authentication apps
    - Uses a pseudo random token generation
        - Could be a physical device or an app
- TOTP Time based one time password algorithm
    - Use a key and time of day
    - Keys only last for a short amount of time
        - Uses NTP for synchronization
- HOTP
    - One time passwords
        - Doesn’t expire until you use it and then it is no longer valid
    - Token based authentication
        - Hardware and software based
            - Hash is different every time
    - Could be stored in an app or physically
- Phone call
    - A voice call could provide you a token
    - Similar disadvantages to SMS
        - Modified messages or forwarding
        - Intercept the call
- Static codes
    - Authentication methods that never change
        - PIN or password
- Smart cards
    - Integrated circuit card for authentication
        - Contact or contactless
    - No one else has the card
    - Multiple factors are always a good idea
