- Ransomware
    - Your data is valuable to you
        - Company data is even more valuable and important
    - How much would you pay to regain access to it?
    - Claiming they encrypted/took your data and requiring you to pay to get it back is ransomware
        - Payment often in bitcoin
    - They could claim to be someone they are not, like the CIA

    - Could be downloaded by the Trojan
    - May cause performance issues but not necessarily malicious
        - Displays adds, redirecting your web searches, ect
    - Can be identified by anti virus software quite easily
- Backdoors
    - Why go through normal authentication methods when you can go through the backdoor?
        - An easy way to get into your system
    - Often placed on your systems via malware
        - Malware can use the backdoors that other malware created to make it easier to get into your system

- Waits for a certain event to be triggered and then activates
    - Occurs when a date and time is reached
    - Occurs when a certain user event takes place
- Hard to identify and hard to recover
    - Many delete themselves once they execute
- Preventing them
    - Formal change control process
        - Know when things are being modified
    - Automated monitoring
        - Host based intrusion detection, Tripwire, ect

## [Password attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNhak8IilrA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=20&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Plaintext passwords
    - Stored in a readable format
    - This is a terrible idea (dont use apps that do this)
- Hashing a password
    - Input your password and pick which hash type to use
        - Get a random series of numbers and letters in return
        - Inputting this password will always give you the same hash but it is very hard to get the password from the hash itself (other than brute force)
- Spraying attacks
    - Avoids locking the account by trying so many passwords
    - Use the most common passwords and moves on if this does not work
        - No alarms, alerts, or lockouts
- Brute Force
    - Trying every single possible password (or hash)
    - Takes a lot of time and a lot of compute power
    - Hard to do online as their is often delays and lockouts
        - But it is possible offline with hashes
- Dictionary attacks
    - Use the most common words to try and find the correct password
    - There are many different wordlists that can be broken down by native language, line of work, hobbies, etc that can be useful if you know things about your target and their life
    - Can substitute letters like replacing 0 with O and replacing 2 with @
    - Takes some time but not nearly as long as brute force attacks
- Rainbow tables
    - An optimized pre-built set of hashes
    - Easy and quick to search through
        - Almost instantly
    - Need different tables for different hashing methods
- Adding salt
    - Random data added to a password BEFORE it is hashed
    - Every user gets their own random salt data
    - Rainbow tables will not work against this
        - Slows down the brute force process

## [Physical Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOGCvcfJl4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=21&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

        - Ads recommended based on your search history and other data
        - etc
- Poisoning the training data
    - Confuses the AI with fake info
    - Make the AI act how you want based on the info you sent to it
- Evasion attacks
    - AI is only as good as the training
    - Attackers can change their approach to try and get around the machine learning
    - An attacker may be able to extract the data from a AI that used real world information to be trained
- Securing the learning algorithms
    - Make sure learning data is legitimate
    - Keep it up to date with the latest information

## [Supply Chain Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOnjqpw5rXM&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=23&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Many moving parts in the supply chain
    - If one is attacked it can effect the others (the entire chain in some cases)
- People tend to trust the supplies even though they could have been attacked
- Supply chain security
    - Make sure what you are installing is trust worthy
    - Limit the number of vendors you work with
    - Have good policies and procedures (make sure your suppliers do the same)

## [Cloud-based vs On-premises attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ta0rVTL_g&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=25&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Attacks can happen anywhere
- Cloud security
    - Everything is centralized
    - Cheaper
    - No physical access
    - Third party does have access though
    - Large scale security that may be better than what you can do
    - Need to make sure your users are following the best practices
    - Limited downtime due to more redundancy and high quality products
    - Easy to change and update things
        - May be limited on what you can do with the data though
- On-premises security
    - On site and more costly
    - Full control of everything
    - On site team makes things more secure (hire the right people)
    - No need to call out to a third party
    - Take be time consuming and not instantaneous

## [Cryptographic Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ta0rVTL_g&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=25&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Encrypted data sent to another person may not be secure the whole way to its destination
- Finding ways to undo security during the transfer process
    - implementation is often the problem
- Birthday attack
    - Hash collision is when you have two very different plaintexts that both create the same hash
        - Should not happen
    - Attacker tries to find the other plaintexts the matches a certain hash
        - Can be prevented by increasing the has output size
- Collisions
    - Hashes are supposed to be a unique value and it is quite bad when they are not
- Downgrade attack
    - Instead of using a good encryption you use something that is not that great
        - Force system to downgrade security
    - Sit in the middle and influence the encryption choice between two systems
        - Man in the middle attack may be used for this
## [Privilege Escalation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksjU3Iu195Q&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=26&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Gain high access to a system
    - Admin or root access from a normal users access
- Or just gaining access another user of the same level account
- Tend to be patch quickly
    - Keep anti virus up to date
- Data Execution prevention
    - Only allows applications to run in certain areas of memory
- Randomize where stuff is stored in memory to keep people from find the same data over multiple systems

## [Cross-site Scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI0XF2xFg8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=27&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- aka XSS
    - Originally a browser vulnerability that allowed info from on site to be shared with another
- Common web app vulnerabilities
    - Takes advantage of the trust a user has for a site
- Uses JavaScript
- Non-persistent XSS attack
    - A site that allows scripts to run in user input
    - Attacker needs the user to click a link to start this attack (usually an email link)
    - Can get a lot of useful information from the victims machine
- Persistent XSS attack
    - Attacker posts a message to a social network (or other) that has the malicious payload
    - Everyone who reads the post gets the script
    - Many different targets, can spread quickly
- Tokens should have a limited amount of time and should NOT last forever
    - If they last forever you can get around the need to login
- Protecting against it
    - Be careful when clicking links
    - Could disable JavaScript entirely (but not very practical)
    - Keep your browser up to date
    - Devs should make sure that their input fields are validated

## [Injection Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4KUdwh8rGo&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=28&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Code Injection
    - Attacker puts their own code into a data stream
    - HTML, SQL, XML, ect
- SQL injection
    - The most common relational database management system language
    - Your site should not allow this, but some do
- XML Injection
    - XML is common for transferring data between devices
    - Modifying the XML requests
        - This should not be possible
- LDAP injection
    - Has useful information stored in it
    - Modify the requests to get what you want
- DLL Injection
    - Inject code into an application and make the application execute the code
    - Runs as part of the normal process by attaching itself to a normal process

## [Buffer Overflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szTG9w3jImA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=29&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- When one section of memory can overwrite another section of memory
    - Takes advantage of poor programming
- Hard to find and take advantage of
- A good buffer overflow for an attacker is one that can be replicated and is easy to control

## [Replay Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHydDY7wQJg&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=30&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Useful information is often transmitted over the network
    - Hackers can take advantage of this
- Needs to gather the data
    - Network tap, ARP poisoning, malware victim, etc
    - Get session IDs, credentials, etc
- If an attacker takes this gathered information and replays it through the network like it was coming from you than this is a replay attack
    - Replay attack can happen a long time after the gathering of the data
        - Does not involve the original user
    - Pretend you are the normal user sending normal data
- Session Hijack
    - The attacker gains access to the session ID
    - Can pose as the victim without login details needed
    - Get the session ID from wireshark or kismet
        - Or cross-site scripting
    - These headers or cookies need to then be modified
- Preventing them
    - Encrypting the information can stop this from being and issue as even if the attackers receives the data they cannot unencrypt it
        - Salting and peppering the data also helps
    - Make sure to secure the cookies!
        - They hold information like session management, session IDs, personalization, etc
## [Request Forgeries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmtqMzP7aXI&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=31&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Cross-site requests
    - Common and legitimate

                    - HTML PHP
    - One-click attack / session riding / client side request forgery (XSRF. CSRF)
        - Takes advantages of the trust a site has for the browser
            - Attacker gets access to your accounts via your browser which already has all the info needed
        - Web servers need to put techniques to prevent this
            - Cryptographic tokens or the likes
    - Server side request forgery (SSRF)
        - Sends requests to a web server and the web server performs the request on the behalf of the attacker
            - Allows lots of access that they should not have
        - Needs a vulnerable application running on the web server
            - Caused by bad programming
            - Rare but critical vulnerabilities

## [Driver Manipulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EI0Rs1QAes&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=32&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Traditional anti virus software is good a stopping know vulnerabilities
- There are still ways to get into the system though
    - Unknown attacks (zero-day attacks), new and different attacks
- Attack with the drivers for your system
    - The drivers are trusted by the system already
        - So you can get a lot of information by infecting them
            - Keyloggers, video footage, audio, etc
- Shimming
    - Fit between two objects
    - OS have shims as well
        - Run applications as if they are running in a different OS
            - has a cache to store this information
        - This can be taken advantage of by hackers and place malware here
- Refactoring
    - A different program each time its downloaded
        - Will not match any signatures as it is always different
    - Make the malware look different than it is
    - Hard to detect with signature based detection

## [SSL Stripping (HTTP downgrade)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1QM6G4Zmos&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=33&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Avoiding this
    - Use HTTPS and dont allow downgrades

## [Race Conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg_kTCOcinQ&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=34&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Problems can occur if multiple things happens at the exact same time and you were ready for that
- Time-of-check to time-of-use attack (TOCTOU)
    - Checking for things to occur on the system and making changing while knowing that other things may be going on behind the system
    - Like performing two bank transactions at nearly the same time
        - Could lead to duplicating some of the money and causing issues

## [Other Application Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qobt7mkZk2A&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=35&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Memory vulnerabilities
    - Memory Leaks

        - Application continues to use more and more of the memory until it is all gone
            - System or application crashes | DoS
    - NULL pointer dereference
        - Make a system direct to a null portion of memory where nothing exists instead of the correct data
            - Applications crash, debug info, DoS
    - Integer overflow
        - Large number is placed into a smaller section of memory making said memory overflow
            - Can be repeatable
- Directory transversal
    - Read areas of a server that they should not have access to
        - Bad OS or bad software program
        - May be able to backwards through the file systems to the C drive
- Improper Error handling
    - Errors happens
    - Massages should have just enough information
        - Some tell you too much and this is bad
    - Easy to fix as long as you have control of the application
- Improper input handling
    - All input could be malicious so check it all
    - Dont allow code input like SQL injections
    - Hard for attackers to find these but once they do it can be very bad
- API attacks
    - Manipulating the application programming interference
    - Look for vulnerabilities in the new communication path
        - Exposing data, intercepting communications, more access, DoS, etc
- Resource exhaustion
    - Specialized DoS
    - May use a very small compressed file and that is a HUGE uncompressed file (zip bomb)
        - Anti viruses can detect these
    - DHCP starvation
        - Flooding the network with many new fake devices
        - Make the DHCP server run out of addresses
            - Switch configs can limit the number of requests allowed
## [Rogue Access Points and Evil Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdoHB08VZQU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=36&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- WAP
    - Unauthorized wireless access points
        - Not always malicious but always a security issue
    - Quite easy to do
    - Survey the area every so often to stop this
        - WiFi pineapple or other tools help to stop this
    - Why it is good to use 802.1X
- Wireless Evil Twin
    - Always malicious
    - Designed to look exactly like all of your other WAPs
    - Try to overpower your existing APs (make itself the primary AP)
        - A big issue for already open networks
    - Make sure to encrypt the communication

## [Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP-PYNfOK5g&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=37&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Bluejacking
    - Unsolicited message over Bluetooth
    - Typically limited to a 10 meter distance
        - Attacker needs to be close
    - Can write a message to send to the victim including things like contact card, video, etc
    - Low priority security concern as it is just send a message nothing more
        - As long as the users know how to handle it, it is not that bad
- Bluensarfing
    - Higher security risk
    - Able to access data on your mobile device via the Bluetooth communication channel
    - Was patched quickly and is not an issue on updating modern devices
## [Wireless Disassociation Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJzhe1r_bK4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=38&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Things are working normally, until everything disconnects (and this keeps happening)
    - May not be able to stop this
- A significant DoS attack
- Takes advantage of 802.11 management frames
    - These frames make sure everything works
        - Conversations that you never see but always are happening
    - The original standard did not protect these frames so they could be messed with easily
        - An attacker could cause problems by sending their own management frames and messing with existing ones
- Protecting against it
    - Updates/patches were made a while ago to fix this
    - Made the frames encrypted
        - Not all but some of them (the important ones that can be)
    - 802.11ac requires these protections to be in place

## [Wireless Jamming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKQWbwIAm3U&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=39&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Radio Frequency jamming (RF)
    - DoS
    - Transmit interfering signals to lower the signal to noise ratio
- Sometimes this inference is not intentional
    - But it could be
- Wireless jamming
    - Constant random bits may be sent
    - Constant legitimate traffic may be sent
    - Can happen intermittently as well
    - Only send jamming signal when someone else is also trying to communicate
        - Limited a signal device from communicating
- Interference needs to overwhelm the actual data so it needs to be close to the physical network
    - Hard to hunt down the source
    - May use a fox hunt to find it
        - Find the strongest signal

## [RFID and NFC Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSyFGFIprQU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=40&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Encrypted data should look nothing like the plain text
    - If it does look like the plain text it may be able to be reverse engineered
- Nonce
    - An arbitrary number that is used one time
    - A random number
        - Something that cannot be guessed
    - Often used during a login process
    - Combining the data with the nonce and then sending it across the network
        - Sending the same data will look different every time because the nonce will be different
    - IV (Initialization vector) is a common type of nonce
- Salt
    - Nonce being included in passwords as well
    - Passwords should always be salted

## [On-Path Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY20_7l8AKc&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=42&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Formally known as **man in the middle attack**
- The victim does not know it is happening
- Originally data is intercepted and then passed on to where it needs to go
    - Attack and read and change anything that goes through the communication
- ARP poisoning is a common example of this
    - ARP does not have security so this is easy to do
        - Change the ARP table in a device to redirect traffic to the attacker
        - Requires the attacker to be on the local network
- On-path browser attack
    - Attacker is on the same computer as the victim
    - Malware that is the relay between the victim and the other devices is on the victims browser
        - Usually an automated process that handles all of this
    - Can read the plain text data unlike with ARP poisoning

## [MAC Flooding and Cloning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54kfAXpQtWo&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=43&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- I’m not going to write all of this because I already know it and I am too lazy to do it again
- MAC Flooding
    - There is only so much room in the MAC table
    - Attackers could try and fill up the table
        - Force out the legitimate MAC addresses
        - When the table is full it sends every frame to every device
            - Now acts like a hub
            - Could easily overload the network
            - Also good for the attacker to get all of the data
    - Most switches protect against this
        - Flood Guard
- MAC cloning / MAC spoofing
    - Modify their MAC to match the MAC of a legit device on the network
    - Circumvent the filters on the firewalls
    - Could create a DoS attack
        - Disrupt communication to the legitimate MAC
    - Easily to modify this address
    - Many built in features try to prevent this

## [DNS Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwH0ki_k2s&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=44&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

    - Get access to the domain registration and control where the traffic flows
        - Via brute force, social engineering or other ways
- URL Hijacking
    - Making a domain name that is close to the legitimate one
        - Could sell the fake URL to the real owner to “get rid of the problem” while making money
        - Could redirect the traffic to the competitor use it a phishing opportunity, installing malware and more
    - Typosquatting / brandjacking
        - Takes advantage of poor spelling by making a site slightly off from the real one
        - Could also use a different top level domain like .org
- Domain reputation
    - Internet is always tracking your security posture
    - Email reputation
        - Company is infected with malware and sends spam
        - Can cause an email service to fail
        - Sites can check your reputation and help you monitor this
    - Domain reputation
        - Infect systems are noticed by the search engines
        - The search engine will no longer trust your site
## [Denial of Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpgGMMHa-lU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8&index=45&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)

- Could be done unintentionally
- DDoS
    - Use many systems to attack a single service
    - Often use botnets for this
        - Can have thousands of millions of computers
- DDoS amplification
    - A small attack arrives to the victim as a much larger attack
    - Have a small request be a huge response
        - Be able to shutdown services with much more resources than the attacker has
        - Could be done with a DNS server or other things
- Application DoS
    - Make the application work harder or break
    - Fill up all of the disk space
        - Use a small uncompressed file that turns out to be a VERY larger uncompressed file
            - A Zip Bomb
- Cloud Based DoS
    - Overuse a measured cloud resource
        - Get the application to add more and more resources and spend more money
    - Slow down the response times
